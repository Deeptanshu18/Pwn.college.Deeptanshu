I first tried running /challlenge/run but got "No such file or directory" due to a typo. Correcting it to /challenge/run, the program said I wasn't in the correct directory. Using cd /etc, I navigated to the required directory and re-ran the program. The challenge executed successfully, producing the flag.

hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challlenge/run
bash: /challlenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect... You are not currently in the /etc directory. Please use the cd utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /etc
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/etc$ /challenge/run
Correct!!! /challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag: pwn.college{U8odpKZzpKP7Ymr_OKRAqBp-SSP.QX2QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I Learned
I learned how absolute paths work in Linux and the importance of being in the correct current working directory (cwd) when executing a program. This reinforced the concept that the current directory affects relative and absolute path resolution.

#Position Elsewhere
Navigate to another specified directory using cd before executing /challenge/run.

Initially ran /challenge/run from the home directory and received a message about being in the wrong directory. I used cd /var to move to the correct location, then executed /challenge/run. This successfully returned the flag.

hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect... You are not currently in the /var directory. Please use the cd utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /var
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/var$ /challenge/run
Correct!!! /challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag: pwn.college{8werDYWK62YL3kDj9U-jTXAW7GO.QX3QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I learned
This reinforced the concept of absolute paths and that /challenge/run must be invoked from the directory the program expects. Different challenges can require navigating to different directories.

#Position Yet Elsewhere
Navigate to a deeper directory before running /challenge/run.

Flag: pwn.college{wrau69nZGt_M40evBMlxoXv6Wdr.QX4QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}
Running /challenge/run initially produced an error about being in the wrong directory. Using the hint, I navigated to /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia and executed the program successfully to get the flag.

hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect... You are not currently in the /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia directory. Please use the cd utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia$ /challenge/run
Correct!!! /challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag: pwn.college{wrau69nZGt_M40evBMlxoXv6Wdr.QX4QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I learned
Practiced navigating through nested directories and understood how absolute paths are crucial when programs expect to be run from specific locations.

#Implicit Relative Paths From /
Run /challenge/run using a relative path instead of an absolute path.

#My solve
Flag: pwn.college{AwzfzgmxbIr9XpEMxVbw8yJcL3j.QX5QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}
Started in / and used the relative path challenge/run instead of the absolute /challenge/run. Executing the command produced the flag.

hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!! challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag: pwn.college{AwzfzgmxbIr9XpEMxVbw8yJcL3j.QX5QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I learned
Understood relative paths and how they are resolved from the current working directory. Learned that relative paths don’t need to start with /.

#References
pwn.college tutorials.

#Explicit Relative Paths From /
Run /challenge/run with a relative path that explicitly starts with .

#My solve
Flag: pwn.college{swkDgxCSjexUQwicdetM44p-UTT.QXwUTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}
Executed ./challenge/run from / to explicitly indicate the current directory. This satisfied the challenge's requirement to use . for relative paths.

hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!! ./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag: pwn.college{swkDgxCSjexUQwicdetM44p-UTT.QXwUTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I learned
Learned the significance of . in Linux paths, explicitly referencing the current directory. Also learned Linux safety measures prevent executing “naked” programs in the current directory by default.

#Implicit Relative Paths
Run /challenge/run from the /challenge directory using relative path.

#My solve
Flag: pwn.college{cBSbwq9RmotVUTV0iBXaKq00FCy.QXxUTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}
Navigated to /challenge and ran ./run to invoke the program correctly from the current directory. Flag returned successfully

hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!! ./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag: pwn.college{cBSbwq9RmotVUTV0iBXaKq00FCy.QXxUTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I learned
Practiced running programs using relative paths from within the target directory. Reinforced why Linux does not allow running programs from the current directory automatically without ./.

#Home Sweet Home
Use /challenge/run to write a flag to a file in your home directory using a short absolute path.

#My solve
Flag: pwn.college{snx8nIwKVFiItcDbanROOeLL8Zk.QXzMDO0wSN0EzNzEzW}
Ran /challenge/run ~/a to write the flag to the file /home/hacker/a using an absolute path inside my home directory. The program output the flag successfully.

hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a! ... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{snx8nIwKVFiItcDbanROOeLL8Zk.QXzMDO0wSN0EzNzEzW}

#What I learned
Learned about the ~ shorthand for home directories, writing files using absolute paths, and the constraints of short paths for challenge programs.
